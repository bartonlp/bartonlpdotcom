# node.js Examples
## This directory's files use the node_module in this directory.

The **websocket-client.js** can be run on any computer that has a recent version of node.js.
The **websocket-test.php** can be run on any computer browser.

The **websocket-server.js** should be run on this server (**bartonlp.com**) with the current
version of node.js. Enter

    node websocket-server.js

It will listen on port 8080 for client
requests from the client programs.

The **websocket.conf** is an example of how to set up **upstart**. This server actually runs
**systemd** and I do not have a config file for that yet.
