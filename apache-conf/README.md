# Files from /etc/apache2/sites-enabled
These are the enabled sites on 157.245.129.4 (bartonlp.org).

NOTE: the files bartonlp.conf and bartonlp-le-ssl.conf have a special RewriteRule to prevent people from going to
the other sites (directories) in this root. In all of the other domains I have been able to place the RewriteRule-s
in the .htaccess files, but for this directory it doesn't seem to work for directories. I do have file RewriteRule-s
for the file I don't want people to view in the .htaccess file. Who knows?
